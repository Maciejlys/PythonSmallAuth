# About the project

Small authorization app that manages registering and loging in.\
I didn't use any database since its supposed to be small project\
I just hold all registered users in dictionary, so on server restart\
all users will be wiped clean

# What was used in this project?

- flask
- pyjwt
- hashlib

# What would I change?

I think I learned alot while doing this projcet, and thats why \
if I had to redo it I would definitely make sure that the code\
is split up and easier to reuse.
